/**
 * StudentPaneView is a view that displays information about and presents interactivity for an
 * instance of the Student class. It contains the name of the student, a switch for present/absent,
 * and a swipe-left function for revealing additional options pertaining to attendance. Later, it
 * will also contain a long-press functionality for additional interactivity with the Student
 * instance.
 *
 * Naturally, when this is constructed, it will need to have access to a single student object.
 * Other than that, it shouldn't need anything other than the context. The color of the main pane
 * will be determined by the conditional formatting from the student object.
